4.  **Create `ApplicationDbContext`:** Set up the database context for EF Core.
5.  **Configure `appsettings.json`:** Add the database connection string.
6.  **Register `ApplicationDbContext`:** Configure the DbContext in `Program.cs`.
7.  **Create initial migration:** Generate the database schema.
8.  **Apply migration:** Update the database with the new schema.
9.  **Create `blueprint.md`:** Document the project and the initial setup process.
